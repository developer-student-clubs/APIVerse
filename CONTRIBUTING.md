# Contributing Guidelines APIVerseüéØ!

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

### Step 0 : Find an issue

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

### Step 1 : Fork the Project

- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile.
   Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>  
cd <repo-name>  
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>  

```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

```bash
git remote update
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase upstream/<branch-name>

```

### Step 2 : Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b branch_name

```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

```bash
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
git add <some files>

```

### Step 4 : Commit

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

```bash
git commit -m "message"  

```

### Step 5 : Work Remotely

- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash
git push -u origin Branch_Name

```

### Step 6 : Pull Request

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests.
   Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.

### Alternatively contribute using GitHub Desktop

1. **Open GitHub Desktop:**
   Launch GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account if you haven't already.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If you haven't cloned the APIVerse repository yet, you can do so by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Clone Repository."
   - Choose the APIVerse repository from the list of repositories on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

3. **Switch to the Correct Branch:**
   - Ensure you are on the branch that you want to submit a pull request for.
   - If you need to switch branches, you can do so by clicking on the "Current Branch" dropdown menu and selecting the desired branch.

4. **Make Changes:**
   Make your changes to the code or files in the repository using your preferred code editor.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - In GitHub Desktop, you'll see a list of the files you've changed. Check the box next to each file you want to include in the commit.
   - Enter a summary and description for your changes in the "Summary" and "Description" fields, respectively. Click the "Commit to <branch-name>" button to commit your changes to the local branch.

6. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   After committing your changes, click the "Push origin" button in the top right corner of GitHub Desktop to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
  - Go to the GitHub website and navigate to your fork of the APIVerse repository.
  - You should see a button to "Compare & pull request" between your fork and the original repository. Click on it.

8. **Review and Submit:**
   - On the pull request page, review your changes and add any additional information, such as a title and description, that you want to include with your pull request.
   - Once you're satisfied, click the "Create pull request" button to submit your pull request.

9. **Wait for Review:**
    Your pull request will now be available for review by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback or ask for changes before merging your pull request into the main branch of the APIVerse repository.
